;;; scrutiny-agent.el --- Client for the scrutiny-agent remote backend  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Author: Lally Singh
;; URL: https://github.com/five-rivers/scrutiny-agent
;; Version: 0.2.0
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "29.1"))
;;
;; 29.1 is the PACKAGE's floor, because scrutiny-agent-ui.el uses
;; `defvar-keymap' and scrutiny-agent-eglot.el needs eglot, both 29.1.
;; This file on its own runs on 28.1.
;; Keywords: tools, processes

;; This file is part of scrutiny-agent (GPLv3).

;;; Commentary:

;; Connects Emacs to a scrutiny-agent running on a remote host over a
;; user-supplied stdio transport (ssh / ssh -J / tsh / kubectl exec /
;; a local shell).  One persistent, multiplexed JSON-RPC channel per
;; host carries everything -- which is the whole point on links where
;; connection establishment is expensive (Teleport, jump hosts).
;;
;; The wire protocol is docs/protocol.md in the scrutiny-agent repo:
;; JSON-RPC 2.0 over LSP-style Content-Length frames, plus three
;; agent-specific mechanisms this client implements: `rpc.chunk'
;; reassembly for over-cap responses, the cred.request/cred.provide
;; credential broker, and the lsp.tunnel* raw-LSP envelope (see
;; scrutiny-agent-eglot.el for the eglot integration built on it).
;;
;; Connecting bootstraps the agent binary if needed: the remote's
;; OS/arch is probed over the pipe, the matching release binary is
;; downloaded locally (or taken from :local-binary), streamed across
;; as base64 inside a quoted heredoc, hash-gated with sha256, and
;; exec'd.  No scp, no second channel.  A host with :remote-binary
;; skips all of that and runs the binary it names.
;;
;; Minimal setup:
;;
;;   (setq scrutiny-agent-hosts
;;         '(("devbox" :transport "tsh ssh devbox sh")))
;;   M-x scrutiny-agent-connect
;;
;; See emacs/README.md for eglot wiring.

(defcustom scrutiny-agent-hosts nil
  "Alist of remote hosts: (NAME . PLIST).
NAME is a string (matched against TRAMP host names by the eglot
integration).  PLIST keys:

  :transport     (required) shell command whose stdin/stdout reach a
                 POSIX shell on the remote, e.g. \"ssh devbox\",
                 \"tsh ssh devbox sh\", \"kubectl exec -i pod -- sh\", or
                 just \"sh\" for a local agent.  The shell must be on
                 pipes: Teleport gives a plain \"tsh ssh devbox\" a
                 terminal, which the bootstrap detects and refuses.
  :install-dir   remote directory for the agent binary, a shell
                 expression (default \"$HOME/.scrutiny-agent\").
  :agent-args    list of extra agent argv strings, e.g.
                 (\"--allow-root\" \"src\" \"--log\" \"agent.log\").
  :local-binary  a locally built agent binary to stream instead of
                 downloading a release.  A string uses that file for
                 this host; an alist keyed by architecture --
                 ((\"x86_64\" . PATH) (\"aarch64\" . PATH)) -- picks by
                 the arch probed on the remote.
  :remote-binary an agent binary already on the host, as a shell
                 expression, e.g. \"$HOME/src/x/build/agent/scrutiny-agent\"
                 (a leading ~/ becomes $HOME/).  Used as it is:
                 nothing is looked up here, hashed, or streamed, and
                 its version need not match this client's.  It is
                 run once with --version before use, and must report
                 the protocol this client speaks
                 (`scrutiny-agent-protocol-version'); one that does
                 not, or does not run there, is an error at connect.
                 Takes precedence over :local-binary.
  :config        agent config file contents to install on this host,
                 overriding `scrutiny-agent-default-config'.  Nil
                 sends none."
