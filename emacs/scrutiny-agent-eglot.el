;;; scrutiny-agent-eglot.el --- Eglot over a scrutiny-agent LSP tunnel  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Author: Lally Singh
;; URL: https://github.com/five-rivers/scrutiny-agent
;; Version: 0.2.0
;; (The package's requirements are declared in scrutiny-agent.el;
;; a Package-Requires header outside the main file has no effect.)
;; Keywords: tools, languages

;; This file is part of scrutiny-agent (GPLv3).

;;; Commentary:

;; Runs eglot's language server on the remote box, tunneled through an
;; established scrutiny-agent connection instead of a fresh TRAMP
;; subprocess.  You edit via TRAMP as usual; LSP rides the agent's
;; multiplexed channel (one persistent transport session, priority
;; lanes, no per-request connection setup) -- the difference is night
;; and day on Teleport-style links.
;;
;; How it works: `lsp.tunnelOpen' spawns the server next to the code;
;; the agent pipes raw LSP bytes both ways (it never reframes them).
;; Locally, a loopback socket pair bridges those bytes to a process
;; object eglot owns, so eglot speaks its native protocol end to end.
;; Because the buffers are TRAMP buffers, eglot already sends the
;; remote-local paths in URIs -- exactly what the remote server
;; expects.
;;
;; Setup, given a host named as in `scrutiny-agent-hosts':
;;
;;   (require 'scrutiny-agent-eglot)
;;   (scrutiny-agent-eglot-setup)   ; wire the built-in language list
;;
;; then M-x eglot in a TRAMP buffer whose host matches (see
;; `scrutiny-agent-eglot-host-alist' when the TRAMP host name differs
;; from the scrutiny-agent host name).  Non-remote buffers, and remote
;; buffers on unconfigured hosts, fall through to eglot's normal
;; server programs.

;;; Code:

(require 'scrutiny-agent)

;; eglot is deliberately not required here.  Loading it pulls in
;; project, xref, flymake and jsonrpc, all of which ship with Emacs and
;; all of which users commonly install newer copies of (eglot itself
;; requires them with `require-with-check' on Emacs 30).  If this file
;; loaded eglot during init, ahead of the package manager putting those
;; newer copies on `load-path', the built-in copies would already be
;; in `features' and eglot's own load would then fail with "Feature
;; `project' is now provided by a different file".  So this file only
;; declares what it needs, and `scrutiny-agent-eglot-setup' registers
;; the contacts from `with-eval-after-load', when eglot -- whichever
;; copy the user ends up with -- loads.
